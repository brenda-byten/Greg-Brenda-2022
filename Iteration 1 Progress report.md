# Report

Our team consisting of Brenda and Greg has split the work evenly between them each person will write about what they have been doing.

Brenda:

I have set up Git Hub and created the project that we have discussed called [ITPM5-Assigment: Plant Nursery](https://github.com/brenda-byten/ITPM5-Assigment/projects/1) including setting up the tasks that we had discussed previously and assign them to the individual responsible for completing each task.

My tasks were to set up GitHub and to research plant life i.e., price range, size and so on, I have put on Git Hub a excel document with the research that was done by Greg and me.

Greg:

I have completed the weekly meeting reports as-well as the persona templates and the stakeholder register. I have also assisted with plant species research.

Up until this point there has been issues around communication with Brittney who we have now eliminated from the group and decided to be a team together (Brenda and Greg) for Iteration 2 it will be easier as we will no longer be relying on others we will be able to assign jobs more easily.
