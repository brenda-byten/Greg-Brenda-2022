# Iteration 3 Progress Report

Greg and Brenda.

Apologies that this report resembles the last one however I used the last one as a template therefore they may resemble each other however they have different content and were created on different days for different iteration submissions.

It has been an interesting, trying and difficult time to work on this project as a team of two people recently, we had the holidays which added a difficult aspect as Brenda has been sick with Recurring Tonsilitis and Greg nearly died from the Delta variant of the Covid 19 Virus. This issue would have not been a problem with a full team however with no contingency plan in place our project came to a standstill and was not worked on in a satisfactory manor for nearly three whole weeks. However due to a refusal to allow nature itself to pull us away from completing our goal we have succeeded.

Brenda completed the base website design.

Greg completed the Risk Assessment Register

Brenda has worked on the Architecture of the Repository

Greg Created the business logo and motto

Meetings in person in the library proved to be the most productive way to work together for this iteration as we were able to work on the project as we were discussing it rather than having to do it remotely from home as we were sick and lacking enthusiasm due to having a smaller team than others in the class. Confidence in our abilities was a limiting factor in achieving ahead of schedule, we were not confident that we could complete the assessment on time or in general as we felt we lacked the skills and knowledge to be able to implement this iteration, which slow down progress and reduced enthusiasm even further alongside facing our own diseased mortality.

Note that the final report will contain all of the final notes and snips in the final submission.
