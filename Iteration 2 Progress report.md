# Iteration 2 Progress report

We have found it difficult along timelines due to withdraw of membership of our team along with restrictions from viral pandemic related paranoid psychosis, and hardware issues. We have found it possible to work around these issues even though we were not able to meet in person as we could do it on Microsoft Teams and sending Emails and text messages, multimedia Messages and Phone calls. We were able to make contact with Snapchat some nights and Tinder also.

Brenda has been walking hard creating a Git Hub repository.

Greg researched cloud server costings and made a recommendation.

Brenda did research on hardware requirements.

Greg researched domain name pricing.

Brenda completed Gnatt Chart
